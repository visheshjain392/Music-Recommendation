🎵 Music Recommendation System Using NLP
A content-based music recommendation system that suggests songs with similar lyrics using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project leverages text analysis techniques to understand lyrical content and recommend songs based on similarity.

🔍 Project Overview
📌 Objective: Recommend similar songs by analyzing song lyrics

🧠 Approach: Content-based filtering using lyrics only

🛠️ Technologies:

Python

Scikit-learn

TF-IDF Vectorization

Cosine Similarity

NLTK (for text preprocessing)

WordCloud (for visualization)

Google Colab (for implementation)

🧩 Features
Lyrics preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, regex cleaning)

TF-IDF feature extraction from song lyrics

Cosine similarity-based recommendation engine

WordCloud generation for lyrical insight

Clean and modular Google Colab implementation
